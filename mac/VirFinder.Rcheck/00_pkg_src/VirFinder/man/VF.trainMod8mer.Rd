The prediction models trained using sequences of various lengths from virus and host complete genomes.
%%   ~~ data name/kind ... ~~
}
\description{
The data contains three prediction models trained using 500, 1000 and 3000 bp viral and host sequences respectively.
The viral sequences were generated by spliting virus complete genomes into non-overlapping fragments. The same number of host non-overlapped fragments were choosen to pair with the viral fragments as training data.
Each sequence in the training data is then represented using a 8-tuple word frequency vector. The classification model for virus and host sequences is trained based on their word frequencies.

The data also contains three distributions of prediction scores for 500, 1000 and 3000 bp host sequences respectively.
The distributions are used as null distributions to compute p-values for query sequences.

\usage{data("VF.trainMod8mer")}
\format{
This variable is for internal use. If users are interested, here is the description of the data.

The value of VF.trainMod8mer is 8, because the model was constructed using 8-tuple word frequencies.

The three prediction models are saved in attr(VF.trainMod8mer, "lasso.mod_0.5k"), attr(VF.trainMod8mer, "lasso.mod_1k"), and attr(VF.trainMod8mer, "lasso.mod_3k")

The three null distributions are saved in attr(VF.trainMod8mer, "nullDis_0.5k"), attr(VF.trainMod8mer, "nullDis_1k"), and attr(VF.trainMod8mer, "nullDis_3k")
