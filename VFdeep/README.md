# VirFinder-deep: Identifying viral sequences from metagenomic data using convolutional neural networks

Authors: Jie Ren, Fengzhu Sun

Maintainer: Jie Ren <renj@usc.edu>

Description
----------------

The package provides functions to predict viral sequences in a fasta file, such as the assembled contigs from metagenomic data. The method has good prediction accuracy for short (~1kb) and noval viral sequences.

VirFinder-deep further improves the prediction accuracy compared to VirFinder using on the greatly enlarged training dataset and the deep learning approach.
